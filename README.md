# Modern Mathematics with Lean

This is an interactive set of resources to accompany the book 'Modern Mathematics'.

It is designed to be used within Visual Studio Code via a pre-installed bundle
or GitHub Codespace. If you aren't reading this in a Visual Studio window
you should either:

1. Downwload a bundle via BLAH or
2. Go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GihanMarasinghaOrg/modern_maths_lean).
    * Click on the green "Code" button
    * Click on the Codespaces tab and
    * Click "Create codespace on main"
    * Wait until the documentation appears. This may take a few minutes.

If you are viewing this in Visual Studio Code, then you should:

1. Close the terminal 'panel' that stretches across the bottom of the screen by
clicking on the X in the top-right of the panel.
2. Click in the editor pane that contains this text and split the editor to right either by typing Ctrl+\ (or Cmd+\ on Mac) or by clicking the split editor button. This button looks like a square bisected by a vertical line.
3. Read the book in the right-most pane. Start by cliking on the link for Chapter 1. Introduction.
