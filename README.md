# Modern Mathematics with Lean

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/GihanMarasinghaOrg/modern_maths_lean)

This is an interactive set of resources to accompany the book 'Modern Mathematics'.

It is designed to be used within Visual Studio Code via a GitPod or GitHub Codespaces. If you aren't reading this in a Visual Studio window you should either:

1. Open the repository in
  [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/GihanMarasinghaOrg/modern_maths_lean)
  and wait while the project builds. This may take a couple of minutes. Then click on the
  `README.md` file (this file!) in the explorer pane in the left pane. Continue reading 
  at [Setting up VSCode](#setting-up-vscode) below.
2. Go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GihanMarasinghaOrg/modern_maths_lean).
    * Click on the green "Code" button
    * Click on the Codespaces tab and
    * Click "Create codespace on main". This creates a codespace
      (a remote virtual machine) on which you will run the Lean project.
    * It may take several minutes to build the codespace. Be patient.
      You only need to create the codespace once. In future, you
      can save time by using the codespace you have built.
    * Once Visual Studio Code opens, wait a little while until
      the documentation appears in the right-hand pane.

## Setting up VSCode

If you are viewing this in Visual Studio Code, then you should:

1. If it's open, close the terminal 'panel' that stretches across the bottom of the screen by
clicking on the X in the top-right of the panel.
2.  Click in the editor pane that contains this text and split the editor to right either
    by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\\</kbd> (or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>\\</kbd> on Mac) or
    by clicking the split editor button. This button looks like a square bisected by a vertical line.
3. Read the book in the right-most pane. Start by clicking on the link for Chapter 1. Introduction.
