  show
      ``show`` is used to state or rephrase the current target of the proof.
      If the current target is to prove ``x + y = x + y``, you can indicate this by typing

      .. code-block:: lean

          show x + y = x + y

      More practically, ``show`` can be used to transform the target to a definitionally equal
      target. For example, if ``f : A → B`` is a function and the target is to show
      ``surjective f``, then the target can be changed to the (definitionally equal) target
      ``∀ (b : B), ∃ (a : A), f(a) = b`` via

      .. code-block:: lean

        show ∀ (b : B), ∃ (a : A), f(a) = b
